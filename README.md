## The Challenges:
Complete these challenges using any tooling of your choice.

Beginner:

Create an automated test that completes the contact us form on the homepage, submits it, and asserts that the form was completed successfully.

Intermediate:

Create an automated test that reads a message on the admin side of the site.
You’ll need to trigger a message in the first place, login as admin, open that specific message and validate its contents.

Advanced:

You’ll have to click ‘Book this Room’, drag over dates you wish to book, complete the required information and submit the booking.
